  babel-sublime
  -------------

  Syntax highlighting has been completely overhauled. The new syntax definition provides better support for modern JavaScript and better compatibility with existing color schemes and tools.

  A few examples of improvements and bug fixes:

  - JSX fragments are fully supported.
  - Anonymous classes work correctly.
  - Missing optional semicolons do not break highlighting.
  - Regular expressions are always correctly detected.

  This is a major change. The new syntax definition has been extensively tested in beta, but if you have any problems then please don't hesitate to report them at https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime/issues.

SublimeLinter
-------------

  SublimeLinter 4.17.0

  Mostly shipping maintenance, we have two notable changes for plugins:

  - Beside the obvious `line` and `col` you can now capture `end_line` and
    `end_col` in the regexes.  The low level `LintMatch` usually used with JSON
    formats also understands these keys of course.

  - If a plugin wants to log something, no need to `import logging; ...` anymore,
    as there is a configured `self.logger` now.

    As a reminder:

    * `self.logger.info("message")` only emits in debug mode
    * `self.logger.warning("message")` always emits to Sublime's builtin console
    * `self.logger.error("message")` popups a panel (usually don't!)
